        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p> I'm deeply passionate about education, learning, technology, and design.
        Whenever I'm not coding, you can find me learning something new on Youtube, or 
        reading about a new design tool that was developed. Also, before I forget...
         I really enjoy brownies!
